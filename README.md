This project focuses on implementing and analysing R-tree based algorithms for spatial data management, involving tasks such as Nearest Neighbour Search and Skyline Search. 
The project is divided into individual tasks, each handled by a group member: 
- Task 1 involves finding the nearest facility using Sequential Scan, Best First (BF), and BF with Divide-and-Conquer algorithms. 
- Task 2 focuses on identifying optimal homes based on cost and size using Sequential Scan, Branch and Bound Skyline (BBS), and BBS with Divide-and-Conquer algorithms. 
- A comprehensive project report presenting the in-depth description of the primary functions which are used in Task 1 and Task 2 and a clear specification of operating system environment, location of input files, any essential input parameters. The report also provides the detailed explanations of the BF algorithm-based nearest neighbour search and BBS-based skyline search, including diagrams and step-by-step analysis.
